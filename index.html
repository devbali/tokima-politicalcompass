    <h2>What is this/ni li seme?</h2>

    <p>The toki ma Political Compass test is a quiz designed to measure one’s attitudes and opinions towards the international auxiliary language [toki ma] (link to website here.) It combines the compass design of the [Sapply test] (link) with the UI of [8values] (link).<br><br>
    You will be presented with a statement and then respond to it, from Strongly Agree (mi li pilin sama mute) to Strongly Disagree (mi li pilin ante mute). Each answer slightly affects your score. At the end of the quiz, your position on a political compass will be calculated and displayed.<br><br>
    There are three axes that are measured—wapolan anu nasa (canon versus unofficial), ulokan anu nalama (prescriptivist versus descriptivist), & nasin ante anu nasin awen (progressive versus conservative.)<br><br>
